STEAM Summer Camp,"One Week Summer Camp at STEAM Varsity MakerSpace - Gurugram | Booking will be valid for whole week- Monday to Friday (2 hours each day) The STEAM Summer Camp offers an exciting, interdisciplinary, project-based learning experience that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) with hands-on activities and cutting-edge technologies, all within a vibrant makerspace culture .
Designed for students who are passionate about learning through creativity, collaboration, and innovation, this camp provides an engaging environment where young minds can thrive during the summer break.
At the core of the camp is a makerspace -a dynamic, collaborative environment where students have access to a wide range of tools, technologies, and materials to bring their ideas to life.
This makerspace culture emphasizes learning by doing, encouraging students to experiment, prototype, and iterate on their projects while working together in teams.
Participants will engage in a variety of project-based challenges that allow them to explore diverse fields and develop both technical and creative skills: 3D Printing : Students will design and print their own creations, applying engineering principles to create functional models or artistic designs, all while learning the basics of 3D design and manufacturing.
Robotics : Campers will build and program robots to complete tasks, gaining hands-on experience in electronics, mechanics, and automation while fostering collaboration and problem-solving.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) : Dive into the world of AI by creating smart systems like chatbots or image recognition tools, understanding the fundamentals of machine learning, and applying them to real-world challenges.
App Inventor : Students will design and develop mobile apps, applying coding principles to create interactive applications that address problems and provide solutions in the digital world.
Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) : Explore the possibilities of AR and VR by creating immersive experiences that combine creativity, design, and technology to build interactive worlds.
Throughout the camp, students will work on project-based learning , where they apply the skills from each workshop to create a final, collaborative project.
For instance, they may design a robotic system that uses AI to interact with AR environments, or combine 3D printing with app development to create a unique, interactive mobile experience.
The makerspace culture encourages students to take risks, experiment, and learn from failure, fostering critical thinking and resilience.
In this hands-on environment, students not only gain technical knowledge but also develop key skills such as teamwork, communication, and creativity.
By blending interdisciplinary projects with the collaborative, experimental nature of a makerspace, the STEAM Summer Camp provides a dynamic learning experience where students can unlock their full potential and discover how various fields of study work together to solve complex, real-world problems.",https://cdn-az.allevents.in/events4/banners/0b58cf90-3579-11f0-9451-d5588ce6a2f1-rimg-w1200-h600-dc482d8e-gmir.jpg?v=1747745444,1,2025-05-23,0.0,4.5,tourist,2,Steam Varsity Makerspace: Gurugram,14:00,14:00

Saubhagye - Tthastu Media  storytelling and poetry show ,"SAUBHAGYE 🙏 Organized by : *TTHASTU MEDIA* collaboration with *PATHIK RASTE KA* 🌸 Supported by : AUTHOR VIKAS ROY Book : ONCE I WAS ALIVE Show description : ""A person values anything only when they don't have it or when they lose it.
Whether it's earned name respect wealth or the love received from loved ones.
The person has forgotten that they are complete within themselves.
And at times when they can't find happiness within themselves they start seeing faults in others to appear superior.
Although everyone has flaws in one form or another.
But one's own flaws are never visible to oneself nor what they have achieved.
What's visible is only false status pretense and who knows what else.
With such thoughts we are coming with a show named - 'Saubhgye' with eight excellent performers.
We request all of you to please participate in this show as an audience.
Note : Performance is not allowed for everyone in this show .
